# Overview

This repository serves as a public archive of open-access documents from the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET), which can be found on [jvet-experts.org](https://jvet-experts.org/).

# Purpose

The primary aim of this repository is to enhance the accessibility and searchability of JVET documents, where [the original website](https://jvet-experts.org/) lacks a cross-conference search function and the ability to view the evolution of standard methods. It is worth mentioning that, in contrast, the [MPEG document system](https://dms.mpeg.expert/) offers basic search functionality.

By transcribing the web documents into markdown format to make docs searchable, this repository seeks to provide a more user-friendly way to navigate through the documents. Please note that the content remains hosted on the jvet-experts.org domain and this repository is not meant to any scraping or strict mirroring of content.

# Feedback and Concerns

It is crucial to state that this repository contains only publicly available materials in their proposal stage and does not include any working drafts outputted by the committees. According to the procedures, ISO, IEC, and ITU record patent declarations made voluntarily by individuals who believe they hold rights to the standards, where patent declarations are also made by technology submitters to MPEG, either as responses to a Call for Proposals or as independent submissions (such as Core Experiment results). ISO and IEC simply record such declarations without asserting any position on their validity. The actual "ownership" claims or agreements to recognize such claims are to be determined externally to ISO. This repository is merely serving as an entry for multimedia professionals interested in the technological progression and standardization of technology.

Should you believe that the repository in any way infringes upon rights, or if you deem the provision of a search portal inappropriate, please raise an issue or contact me directly. I have no objections to such concerns and will promptly DELETE this repository.
